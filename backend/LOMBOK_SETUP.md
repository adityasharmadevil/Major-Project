# Lombok Setup Guide

## Issue
If you're seeing compilation errors about missing getters/setters (e.g., `cannot find symbol: method getUsername()`), this is because Lombok annotation processing isn't working.

## Solutions

### For IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Install Lombok plugin:
   - Go to `File` → `Settings` → `Plugins`
   - Search for "Lombok" and install
   - Restart IDE

2. Enable Annotation Processing:
   - Go to `File` → `Settings` → `Build, Execution, Deployment` → `Compiler` → `Annotation Processors`
   - Check "Enable annotation processing"
   - Click "Apply" and "OK"

3. Invalidate Caches:
   - Go to `File` → `Invalidate Caches...`
   - Select "Invalidate and Restart"

### For Eclipse:
1. Install Lombok:
   - Download lombok.jar from https://projectlombok.org/download
   - Run: `java -jar lombok.jar`
   - Follow the installation wizard

2. Enable Annotation Processing:
   - Right-click project → `Properties`
   - Go to `Java Compiler` → `Annotation Processing`
   - Enable "Enable annotation processing"

### For VS Code:
1. Install "Language Support for Java" extension
2. Install "Lombok Annotations Support" extension
3. Restart VS Code

### Alternative: Manual Getters/Setters
If Lombok continues to cause issues, you can temporarily add explicit getters/setters to the DTOs and models until the annotation processing is fixed.

## Verification
After setup, rebuild the project:
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

The application should compile successfully with all getters/setters generated by Lombok.
